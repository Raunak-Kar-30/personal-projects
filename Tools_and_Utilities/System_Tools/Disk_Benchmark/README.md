# A simple disk benchmarking utility for linux\
This is a simple disk benchmarking project that utilizes the /dev/zero and /dev/random files in the linux system to\
benchmark the read(not implemented yet) and write speeds of whichever disk you pass as an argument to this program.\
\
If someone decides to work with this, kindly verify the code before executing. \
I am not a professional and can man mistakes.\
